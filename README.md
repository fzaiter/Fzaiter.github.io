# PERSONAL CURRICULUM VITAE WEB

## A responsive online CV using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project showcases a personal CV in a responsive and custom-designed website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Entirely crafted from scratch, it reflects my skills and creativity. Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own portfolio or CV website.

- **Personalized Style:** Unique design highlighting the information through a creative and engaging approach.
- **Interactive Elements:** Utilizes JavaScript for a progress bar, smooth scroll to top, and copy-to-clipboard information to add interactivity, enhancing user engagement and providing an dynamic browsing experience.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts to fit various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Easy Github Pages Hosting:** The website is hosted on Github Pages, making it free and simple to implement.
- **Sticky Section Titles:** Sticky titles keep the user informed about the section they're in, even on smaller screens.
- **CV Download:** A single click opens the printable CV in a new tab.
- **Accessible Contact Information:** The website features a dedicated section for contact information, making it easy for potential employers or collaborators to reach out.
- **Language Selection:** A header offers users a choice of language versions.

## Future Work

Although the project has initially been considered as a more detailed version of the CV optimised to be viewed as a single page (and which I believe currently meets these requirements), it could be developed into a more complex version. 

- This extended version would include more information about each experience, including more images and more detailed descriptions by establishing a structure of more pages through which we could click on the different titles to be taken to pages where these would be developed. This would serve to create a lighter home page with only the key information that would allow an overview of the trajectory.

- When creating a more complex page, consideration should also be given to the use of more Javascript functions to help keep the interaction with the site from becoming more tedious with the introduction of new information.

- In addition to this last point, and also in relation to the design of the website, the use of visual aids should not be ruled out in order to better understand when the different experiences took place. One example that comes to mind among the different options that could be implemented would be the use of a timeline to make the experiences in each phase of clearer.

## Tweak this project for your own needs

To adapt this project for your own CV, you can modify the information contained in the HTML files. Each section is contained within a separate section element, which you can expand while keeping the rest collapsed. The main elements to modify are dates, titles, and descriptions.

Additionally, don't forget to update the icons to match your information and remember to update the links they point to.

## Lessons learned

1. Plan and outline the content: Before starting to design and develop my website, I took the time to plan and outline the content and structure. This helped me to organize my thoughts, prioritize my ideas, and create a clear and concise website.
2. Keep it simple and intuitive: I aimed to create a website that was easy to navigate and understand. I used a simple structure and intuitive layouts to achieve this goal.
3. Use responsive design: To ensure the website looked great on all devices, I used responsive design techniques. This allowed me to create a website that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, without sacrificing the user experience.
4. Test and iterate: To ensure that my website was of high quality I tested it thoroughly and made adjustments as needed. This included testing on different devices and browsers, and seeking feedback from others.
5. Learn from others: To improve my skills and knowledge, I learned from other developers and designers. This included studying their code, reading their blogs and articles.
